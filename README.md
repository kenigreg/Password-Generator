# Password Generator
This project aims to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected.

The user can decide if the password they want generated include Special characters, Lowercase, Uppercase, Numbers. The user also selects the length of characters they want the password to be (between 8 and 128 characters).

## Functionality
Open the application in a browser. You will be prompted to input the length of password characters you want to generate. This has to be a number between 8 and 128, both inclusive.

You will then be asked to confirm if you want to have lowercase, uppercase, numeric and/or special characters in the password you want to generate. You have to confirm at least one character type to proceed.

Once these are confirmed, click the Generate Password button on the browser page to see the password that has been generated based on the criteria to have chosen.

If you need to generate a new password, repeat the process stated above.
